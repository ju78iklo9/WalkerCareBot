# WalkerCareBot
A bipedal platform to test robotic joints in simulation.

Without going into technical details, our human-looking electromechanical caregivers must be agile, attentive, listen and respond accurately to voice commands.  Designs call for legs and arms, human-looking face, realistic eye movements, feet, soft hands and fingers, etc.  Robotic designs that make it through our future manufacturing facilities may not emit unnecessary mechanical sounds.  Design requirements outline them to be as quiet as a trained and trusted house pet you never see or hear until they know itâ€™s silently time to wake you in the morning.

If one thinks about it, just how many patients on extended care do you think could survive daily visual contact with a  clicking or clanking robot contraption, getting them up and out of bed, making calls to their doctor or family, measuring vitals, or assisting them with using the bathroom (activities caregivers assist certain patients with)?

Have peace of mind in the knowledge that we desire to provide lifelike companions to assist our licensed caregivers so their clients may live in a normal caregiver setting in familiar surroundings.
